abstract = {Generally, different companies use distinct software development process. Due to it,
OMG has specified an architecture to can define a software development process. This
architecture uses a metamodel which is able to be abstracted from particular characteristics
and to give the possibility of defining the different software development processes.
The Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) is a metamodel used for describing
a concrete software development process. Also, the OMG specify a standardized language
to model business processes. This language is called Business Process Modeling Notation
(BPMN).In this paper, a formalization of transformations between SPEM and BPMN is
specified. The transformations are done using the language of formal specification
RSL.One time that we obtain a BPMN specification, it is possible to generate XPDL
code or BPEL code. The workflow technology can use this code and execute the process.
It allows automate the business process, but in this case, the process is a software
development process. Consider that workflow technologies automate, totally or partially,
the business processes enabling an interaction between men and machines, under an
established set of procedural rules. Such technologies use standard languages, like
BPEL or XPDL, to specify the business process which is executed in a workflow engine.
The BPMN allows to generate BPEL or XPDL codes. Therefore, if we specify a software
development process using SPEM, we will automate this process using the workflow technology
due to transformations between SPEM and BPMN done in this paper.},

abstract = {Most existing Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) editing tools are graphical,
and as such based on explicit modeling, requiring good knowledge of the notation and
its semantics, as well as the ability to analyze and abstract business requirements
and capture them by correctly using the notation. As a consequence, their use can
be cumbersome for live modeling during interviews and design workshops, where participants
should not only provide input but also give feedback on how it has been represented
in a model. To overcome this, in this paper we present the design and evaluation of
BPMN Sketch Miner, a tool which combines notes taking in constrained natural language
with process mining to automatically produce BPMN diagrams in real-time as interview
participants describe them with stories. In this work we discuss the design decisions
regarding the trade-off between using mining vs. modelling in order to: 1) support
a larger number of BPMN constructs in the textual language; 2) target both BPMN beginners
and business analysts, in addition to the process participants themselves. The evaluation
of the new version of the tool in terms of how it balances the expressiveness and
learnability of its DSL with the usability of the text-to-visual sketching environment
shows encouraging results. Namely, while BPMN beginners could model a non-trivial
process with the tool in a relatively short time and with good accuracy, business
analysts appreciated the usability of the tool and the expressiveness of the language
in terms of supported BPMN constructs.},

abstract="The management of collaborative business processes refers to the design, analysis, and execution of interrelated production, logistics and information processes, which are usually performed by different independent enterprises in order to produce and to deliver a specified range of goods or services. The effort to interconnect independently developed business process models and to map them to process-implementing software components is particularly high. The implementation of such collaborative inter-organizational business process models is assisted by so-called choreography languages that can be executed by software applications. In this paper, we present a Petri net based approach for process-model driven deduction of BPEL code. Our approach is based on a specific type of high-level Petri nets, so-called XML nets. We use XML nets both for modeling and coordinating business processes implemented as Web services and for deriving BPEL elements of the Web service based components. Our approach provides a seamless concept for modeling, analysis and execution of business processes.",

Given such a repository, this paper deals with the problem of retrieving those models in the repository that most closely resemble a given process model or fragment thereof. Up to now, there is a notable research gap on comparing different approaches to this problem and on evaluating them in the same setting. Therefore, this paper presents three similarity metrics that can be used to answer queries on process repositories: (i) node matching similarity that compares the labels and attributes attached to process model elements; (ii) structural similarity that compares element labels as well as the topology of process models; and (iii) behavioral similarity that compares element labels as well as causal relations captured in the process model. These metrics are experimentally evaluated in terms of precision and recall. The results show that all three metrics yield comparable results, with structural similarity slightly outperforming the other two metrics. Also, all three metrics outperform text-based search engines when it comes to searching through a repository for similar business process models.},

To design such systems, business process modeling is effective, however, the models include often abstractness and arbitrariness. Therefore, there have been efforts that validate rigorousness of the models. They have defined semantics of the models and applied various logics and formal methods to verification of the rigorousness. This paper focuses on formal verification of the models and surveys the efforts. We also discuss the prospect of the solutions. The establishment of the verification will be surely helpful toward solving the problems on business process reengineering, business process management, service-oriented architecture, and so on.},

These communication actions are interrelated by control-flow dependencies expressed through constructs close to those found in workflow definition languages.

	abstract = {The Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) is a standard for capturing business processes in the early phases of system development. The mix of constructs in BPMN makes it possible to define models with a range of semantic errors. But the static analysis of BPMN models to detect such errors is hindered by ambiguities in the standard specification and the complexity of the language. The fact that BPMN integrates constructs from graph-oriented process definition languages with features for concurrent execution of multiple instances of a subprocess and exception handling, makes it challenging to provide a formal semantics of BPMN. Even more challenging is to provide a semantics that can be used to analyse BPMN models. This paper proposes a formalisation of BPMN in terms a mapping to Petri nets, for which efficient analysis techniques exist. The mapping has been implemented as a tool that generates code in the Petri Net Markup Language. The formalisation has led to the identification of deficiencies in the BPMN specification.},

		Differences in human versus machine functioning obscure conventional integration. 
		We introduce cognitive work problems (CWP) for rigorous, verifiable functional integration.

		They are technology-neutral, abstract work objects, allowing people and computing to share and transform them in coordination.
		The end-to-end method is illustrated on a system that employs AI for remote patient monitoring (RPM) during COVID-19 home care. 
		The CWP specified \emph{actionable risk awareness} as the medical problem RPM must solve.
		Graphical modeling standards enabled user participation: CWP as finite state machines and system behavior in BPMN. 
		For model checking, the CWP’s logical content was translated to linear temporal logic (LTL) and the BPMN into Promela as inputs to the SPIN model checker. 
		SPIN verified the Promela implements the LTL correctly.
		We conclude the RPM design solves the medical problem and enhances patient safety. 
		The method appears general to many critical systems.},
