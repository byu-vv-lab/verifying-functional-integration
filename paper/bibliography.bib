abstract = {Generally, different companies use distinct software development process. Due to it,
OMG has specified an architecture to can define a software development process. This
architecture uses a metamodel which is able to be abstracted from particular characteristics
and to give the possibility of defining the different software development processes.
The Software Process Engineering Metamodel (SPEM) is a metamodel used for describing
a concrete software development process. Also, the OMG specify a standardized language
to model business processes. This language is called Business Process Modeling Notation
(BPMN).In this paper, a formalization of transformations between SPEM and BPMN is
specified. The transformations are done using the language of formal specification
RSL.One time that we obtain a BPMN specification, it is possible to generate XPDL
code or BPEL code. The workflow technology can use this code and execute the process.
It allows automate the business process, but in this case, the process is a software
development process. Consider that workflow technologies automate, totally or partially,
the business processes enabling an interaction between men and machines, under an
established set of procedural rules. Such technologies use standard languages, like
BPEL or XPDL, to specify the business process which is executed in a workflow engine.
The BPMN allows to generate BPEL or XPDL codes. Therefore, if we specify a software
development process using SPEM, we will automate this process using the workflow technology
due to transformations between SPEM and BPMN done in this paper.},

abstract = {Most existing Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) editing tools are graphical,
and as such based on explicit modeling, requiring good knowledge of the notation and
its semantics, as well as the ability to analyze and abstract business requirements
and capture them by correctly using the notation. As a consequence, their use can
be cumbersome for live modeling during interviews and design workshops, where participants
should not only provide input but also give feedback on how it has been represented
in a model. To overcome this, in this paper we present the design and evaluation of
BPMN Sketch Miner, a tool which combines notes taking in constrained natural language
with process mining to automatically produce BPMN diagrams in real-time as interview
participants describe them with stories. In this work we discuss the design decisions
regarding the trade-off between using mining vs. modelling in order to: 1) support
a larger number of BPMN constructs in the textual language; 2) target both BPMN beginners
and business analysts, in addition to the process participants themselves. The evaluation
of the new version of the tool in terms of how it balances the expressiveness and
learnability of its DSL with the usability of the text-to-visual sketching environment
shows encouraging results. Namely, while BPMN beginners could model a non-trivial
process with the tool in a relatively short time and with good accuracy, business
analysts appreciated the usability of the tool and the expressiveness of the language
in terms of supported BPMN constructs.},

The effort to interconnect independently developed business process models and to map them to process-implementing software components is particularly high. The implementation of such collaborative inter-organizational business process models is assisted by so-called choreography languages that can be executed by software applications. In this paper, we present a Petri net based approach for process-model driven deduction of BPEL code. Our approach is based on a specific type of high-level Petri nets, so-called XML nets. We use XML nets both for modeling and coordinating business processes implemented as Web services and for deriving BPEL elements of the Web service based components. Our approach provides a seamless concept for modeling, analysis and execution of business processes.",

Given such a repository, this paper deals with the problem of retrieving those models in the repository that most closely resemble a given process model or fragment thereof. Up to now, there is a notable research gap on comparing different approaches to this problem and on evaluating them in the same setting. Therefore, this paper presents three similarity metrics that can be used to answer queries on process repositories: (i) node matching similarity that compares the labels and attributes attached to process model elements; (ii) structural similarity that compares element labels as well as the topology of process models; and (iii) behavioral similarity that compares element labels as well as causal relations captured in the process model. These metrics are experimentally evaluated in terms of precision and recall. The results show that all three metrics yield comparable results, with structural similarity slightly outperforming the other two metrics. Also, all three metrics outperform text-based search engines when it comes to searching through a repository for similar business process models.},

They have defined semantics of the models and applied various logics and formal methods to verification of the rigorousness.

The establishment of the verification will be surely helpful toward solving the problems on business process reengineering, business process management, service-oriented architecture, and so on.},

	abstract = {The Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) is a standard for capturing business processes in the early phases of system development. The mix of constructs in BPMN makes it possible to define models with a range of semantic errors. But the static analysis of BPMN models to detect such errors is hindered by ambiguities in the standard specification and the complexity of the language. The fact that BPMN integrates constructs from graph-oriented process definition languages with features for concurrent execution of multiple instances of a subprocess and exception handling, makes it challenging to provide a formal semantics of BPMN. Even more challenging is to provide a semantics that can be used to analyse BPMN models. This paper proposes a formalisation of BPMN in terms a mapping to Petri nets, for which efficient analysis techniques exist. The mapping has been implemented as a tool that generates code in the Petri Net Markup Language. The formalisation has led to the identification of deficiencies in the BPMN specification.},

		The end-to-end method is illustrated on a system that employs AI for remote patient monitoring (RPM) during COVID-19 home care. 
		The CWP specified \emph{actionable risk awareness} as the medical problem RPM must solve.
		Graphical modeling standards enabled user participation: CWP as finite state machines and system behavior in BPMN. 
		For model checking, the CWP’s logical content was translated to linear temporal logic (LTL) and the BPMN into Promela as inputs to the SPIN model checker. 
		SPIN verified the Promela implements the LTL correctly.
		We conclude the RPM design solves the medical problem and enhances patient safety. 
		The method appears general to many critical systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Incorporating hand gesture recognition in human&ndash;robot interaction has the potential to provide a natural way of communication, thus contributing to a more fluid collaboration toward optimizing the efficiency of the application at hand and overcoming possible challenges. A very promising field of interest is agriculture, owing to its complex and dynamic environments. The aim of this study was twofold: (a) to develop a real-time skeleton-based recognition system for five hand gestures using a depth camera and machine learning, and (b) to enable a real-time human&ndash;robot interaction framework and test it in different scenarios. For this purpose, six machine learning classifiers were tested, while the Robot Operating System (ROS) software was utilized for &ldquo;translating&rdquo; the gestures into five commands to be executed by the robot. Furthermore, the developed system was successfully tested in outdoor experimental sessions that included either one or two persons. In the last case, the robot, based on the recognized gesture, could distinguish which of the two workers required help, follow the &ldquo;locked&rdquo; person, stop, return to a target location, or &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; them. For the sake of safety, the robot navigated with a preset socially accepted speed while keeping a safe distance in all interactions.},

    abstract = { ABSTRACTThere has been steady and significant growth and development of the technology available to pilots on the modern aviation flight deck. From improved information systems such as the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), to increased control of the aircraft (e.g., automated collision avoidance maneuvering) and onwards to overall management of flights (via the Flight Management System, FMS), pilots now have a range of high-tech systems at their fingertips. This technology is designed to support pilots in maintaining situation awareness, making complex decisions, communicating effectively and assisting in flying the aircraft. However, each technological advancement comes with human computer interaction (HCI) considerations that warrant exploration. This special issue aims to bring together new knowledge and best practices, from the scientific community and industry, related to HCI issues on the modern flight deck. The goal of the special issue is to shed light on areas in need of improvement and potential new solutions for maintaining effective HCI on the flight deck. The articles within this special issue incorporate quantitative and qualitative research methods along with HCI design techniques to examine current and future use of technology on the flight deck and how it impacts pilot performance. Although this issue represents a small portion of the challenges pilots face when interacting with technology on the modern flight deck, it will hopefully serve as a lens to focus attention on the many HCI issues that pilots face, the progress that has been made to date, and the many areas that show potential for improvement. }

abstract="We survey the use of the Abstract State Machines (ASM) method for a rigorous foundation of modeling and validating web services, workflows, interaction patterns and business processes. We show in particular that one can tailor business process definitions in application-domain yet rigorous terms in such a way that the resulting ASM models can be used as basis for binding contracts between domain experts and IT technologists. The method combines the expressive power and accuracy of rule-based modeling with the intuition provided by visual graph-based descriptions. We illustrate this by an ASM-based semantical framework for the OMG standard for BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation). The framework supports true concurrency, heterogeneous state and modularity (compositional design and verification techniques). As validation example we report some experiments, carried out with a special-purpose ASM simulator, to evaluate various definitions proposed in the literature for the critical OR-join construct of BPMN.",

abstract="Business process modeling is an important concern in enterprise. Formal analysis techniques are crucial to detect semantic issues in the corresponding models, or to help with their refactoring and evolution. However, business process development frameworks often fall short when it comes to go beyond simulation or syntactic checking of the models. In this paper, we present our VBPMN verification framework. It features several techniques for the automatic analysis of business processes modeled using BPMN, the de facto standard for business process modeling. As such, it supports a more robust development of business processes.",

abstract = {Low-code is a growing development approach supported by many platforms. It fills the gap between business and IT by supporting the active involvement of non-technical domain experts, named Citizen Developer, in the application development lifecycle.Low-code introduces new concepts and characteristics. However, it is not investigated yet in academic research to point out the existing challenges and opportunities when testing low-code software. This shortage of resources motivates this research to provide an explicit definition to this area that we call it Low-Code Testing.In this paper, we initially conduct an analysis of the testing components of five commercial Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDP) to present low-code testing advancements from a business point of view. Based on the low-code principles as well as the result of our analysis, we propose a feature list for low-code testing along with possible values for them. This feature list can be used as a baseline for comparing low-code testing components and as a guideline for building new ones. Accordingly, we specify the status of the testing components of investigated LCDPs based on the proposed features. Finally, the challenges of low-code testing are introduced considering three concerns: the role of citizen developer in testing, the need for high-level test automation, and cloud testing. We provide references to the state-of-the-art to specify the difficulties and opportunities from an academic perspective. The results of this research can be used as a starting point for future research in low-code testing area.},
