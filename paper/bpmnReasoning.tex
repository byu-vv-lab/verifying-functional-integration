Automating the BPMN-to-Promela is not trivial. There are multiple implied semantics in BPMN that make it difficult. For example, parallel gateways are a node in BPMN semantics that indicates the parallel execution of multiple branches. However, the exact same node is used to both fork these branches and to join them. Reasoning about the structure of the BPMN is then necessary to understand exactly how a parallel gateway node should behave in Promela. This logic is also applicable in some ways to XOR gateway nodes.

Additionally, it is necessary to understand which text in the BPMN is flavor text, contributing to the readability, and which text is to be interpreted as conditions. In this project, flows coming out of XOR and complex gateways must be equality or inequality conditions, unless the gateway is acting as a join of multiple branching possibilities as discussed in the previous paragraph.
