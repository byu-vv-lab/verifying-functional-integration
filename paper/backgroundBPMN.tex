The method for generating Promela from a BPMN diagram is similar to a petri-net design. We imagine that the point of execution in the BPMN is a token in the petri-net. The resulting Promela model has one primary "while" loop with a set of nondeterministic options for execution. Each option corresponds to a possible movement of the token. The token is consumed in a node before being created in a following node. Then, execution returns to the primary loop. Because of the nondeterministic nature of Promela and its verifier SPIN, this process can create the comprehensive state space for the BPMN.
