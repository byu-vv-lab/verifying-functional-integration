Automatic translation from CWP and BPMN to LTL properties and Promela code, respectively, is not trivial. First, the edges of the CWP must follow a consistent expression language in order to be interpreted automatically. Next, the object state must be clearly defined. Also, several implied BPMN semantics lead to ambiguous workflow structures, requiring additional automated reasoning. Next, the complete conditions of decision gateways in the workflow must be expressed somewhere. Finally, the environment for running the workflow must be defined, including variables and behavior models for BPMN activities.
